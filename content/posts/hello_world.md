Writing a "Hello World" program is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. Its usually the first program that people are taught to write when learning a new programming language.

The page that we see right now taught me the following things:

1. Setting up a blog using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
2. [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
3. Building and deploying a hugo site using github actions.
