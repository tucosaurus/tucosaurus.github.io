This page is here to honour the tradition when learning new programming languages! 

According to wikipedia:

> A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". It is often the first program written by people learning to code. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
