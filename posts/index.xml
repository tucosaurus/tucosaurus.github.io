According to wikipedia:
A &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo;. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.</description></item></channel></rss>
